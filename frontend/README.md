# Booking Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Booking Page application.

## Structure

- `src/`
  - `components/`: UI components (Header, UserForm, SlotList, etc.)
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks (useBooking)
  - `services/`: API integration (axios setup)
  - `tests/`: Unit tests
  - `utils/`: Helper functions (validation)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
